# Dockerfiles

> Suite of Docker images for general web development purposes

## Overview

This repository is a collection of Docker images I personally use on a daily
basis and conform to a structure based on my best understanding of how Docker
images should be created.

Each image is documented to the best of my ability and should "just work" to
most common expectations.

## Usage

### Building Images

To build all versions of all images, run the `build.sh` script:

```sh
./build.sh
```
